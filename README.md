## How to Use
1. **Compile the Program**:
   Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the source code.
   ```bash
   g++ -o airline_reservation main.cpp
2. **Run the Program**
   ```bash
   ./airline_reservation
Or you can just download the source code from here and run the main file using codeblocks or anyother compilers.
